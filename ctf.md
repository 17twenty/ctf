## Why CTF?
Computer security represents a challenge to education due to its interdisciplinary nature. Topics in computer security are drawn from areas ranging from theoretical aspects of computer science to applied aspects of information technology management. This makes it difficult to encapsulate the spirit of what constitutes a computer security professional.

One approximation for this measure has emerged: the ‘capture the flag’ competition. Attack-oriented CTF competitions try to distill the essence of many aspects of professional computer security work into a single short exercise that is objectively measurable. The focus areas that CTF competitions tend to measure are vulnerability discovery, exploit creation, toolkit creation, and operational tradecraft.

A modern computer security professional should be an expert in at least one of these areas and ideally in all of them. Success in CTF competitions demands that participants be an expert in at least one and ideally all of these areas. Therefore, preparing for and competing in CTF represents a way to efficiently merge discrete disciplines in computer science into a focus on computer security.

## Find a CTF
If you ever wanted to start running, you were probably encouraged to sign up to a 5k to keep focused on a goal. The same principle applies here: pick a CTF in the near future that you want to compete in and come up with a practice schedule. Here are some CTFs that we can recommend:

* [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) and [PlaidCTF](http://www.plaidctf.com/) by CMU
* [HS CTF](http://hsctf.com/) is made for high school students
* [Ghost in the Shellcode (GitS)](http://ghostintheshellcode.com/)
* [CSAW CTF](https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/) by NYU-Poly
* [UCSB iCTF](http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/) is for academics only
* [Defcon CTF](https://legitbs.net/)

Visit [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming) and the [CapCTF calendar](http://captf.com/calendar/) for a more complete list of CTFs occuring every week of the year.

## How is a Wargame different?
Wargames are similar to a CTF but are always ongoing. Typically, they are organized into levels that get progressively harder as you solve more of them. Wargames are an excellent way to practice for CTF! Here are some of our favorites:

* [Micro Corruption](https://microcorruption.com/login)
* [SmashTheStack](http://www.smashthestack.org/)
* [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
* [Exploit Exercises](http://exploit-exercises.com/)

## What about CCDC?
There are some defense-only competitions that disguise themselves as CTF competitions, mainly the Collegiate Cyber Defense Challenge (CCDC) and its regional variations, and our opinion is that you should avoid them. They are unrealistic exercises in frustration and will teach you little about security or anything else. They are incredibly fun to play as a Red Team though!
